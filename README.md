# [Bibliogram](https://bibliogram.art)

## An alternative front-end for Instagram.

Bibliogram works without client-side JavaScript, has no ads or tracking, and doesn't urge you to sign up.

## Instances

The official instance is on https://bibliogram.art.

You can see a list of instances run by the community [on the wiki page](https://github.com/cloudrac3r/bibliogram/wiki/Instances).

If you only use one computer, you can install Bibliogram on that computer and then access the instance through localhost.

## Installing

You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run Bibliogram. Versions before 12.13.0 are untested.

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/cloudrac3r/bibliogram`  
If you are using a fork, be sure to actually install that fork instead!
1. `$ npm install`
1. Edit `/config.js` to suit your server environment
1. `$ npm start`

Bibliogram is now running on `0.0.0.0:10407`.
